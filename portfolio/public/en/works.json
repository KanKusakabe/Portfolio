    "title": "RingSense: Exploring User-defined Gestures for Phone Ring Holders",
    "abstract": "We present RingSense, a phone ring-holder-style device equipped with eight pressure sensors for back-of-device (BoD) interaction on smartphones. The phone ring holder is a ring-type smartphone accessory attached to the back of the smartphone, and RingSense can be easily affixed to the smartphone, similar to a standard smartphone accessory. RingSense serves as both a smartphone input device and a safety accessory for fall prevention. To develop RingSense, we first conducted a gesture elicitation study and created a user-defined gesture set for the phone ring holder. Next, we prototyped RingSense using 8 pressure sensors and a machine-learning-based gesture classification system. We then evaluated our system using the gesture data from 10 participants. Consequently, our system achieved 92.7% accuracy for within-user validation and showed the feasibility of gesture classification by our approach. Finally, we demonstrated some potential applications of RingSense.",

        "abstract": "スマートフォンが普及して久しいが，依然として指でタッチスクリーンを操作する際に生じる操作上の困難であるファットフィンガー問題や片手操作が困難という問題が存在している．これらの問題を扱う研究は多く，特にスマートフォン上での操作性の向上だけでなく外部デバイスを活用したインタラクション領域の拡張に取り組む研究も多い．本稿では，現在スマートフォンのアクセサリとして人気のあるスマホリングに着目し，スマートフォンのインタラクション領域の拡張を目的としたスマートフォン背面のジェスチャ認識を実現するスマホリング型のデバイスを提案する．我々はまず，ユーザ定義型ジェスチャのアプローチで 20 人の参加者へ聞き取り調査を行いスマホリングの最適なジェスチャを設計した．その後，機械学習モデルを使用し，設計したジェスチャを分類する 2 つの分類器を実装し，参加者を集めてジェスチャデータの収集を行った．集めたデータで学習と分類試験を行ったところ，日常動作とジェスチャ入力の分類では 99.1%，ジェスチャの種類の分類では 92.7%の精度が確認された．",

    "title": "Understanding Usability of VR Pointing Methods with a Handheld-style HMD for Onsite Exhibitions",
    "abstract": "Handheld-style head-mounted displays (HMDs) are becoming increasingly popular as a convenient option for onsite exhibitions. However, they lack established practices for basic interactions, particularly pointing methods. Through our formative study involving practitioners, we discovered that controllers and hand gestures are the primary pointing methods being utilized. Building upon these findings, we conducted a usability study to explore seven different pointing methods, incorporating insights from the formative study and current virtual reality (VR) practices. The results showed that while controllers remain a viable option, hand gestures are not recommended. Notably, dwell time-based methods, which are not fast and are not commonly recognized by practitioners, demonstrate high usability and user confidence, particularly for inexperienced VR users.We recommend the use of dwell-based methods for onsite exhibition contexts. This research provides insights for the adoption of handheld-style HMDs, laying the groundwork for improving user interaction in exhibition environments, thereby potentially enhancing visitor experiences.",
