  "introduction": "I am a PhD student at Hokkaido University, where I focus on mobile interaction, gesture recognition, 3D printing applications, and gesture design. I earned both my Bachelor's degree in Engineering and my Master's degree in Information Science from Hokkaido University, which provided me with a solid foundation in both technical and theoretical aspects of my field.\n My current research explores innovative approaches to designing interactive interfaces that bridge the gap between digital and physical experiences. I am particularly passionate about developing user-centered solutions that are tailored to individual needs and diverse use cases. I invite you to explore my recent work, and please feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss potential collaborations or simply exchange ideas."
