    "selfIntrodution": "I am a senior lecturer and researcher at the HCI lab of Jürgen Steimle at Saarland University. Previously, I was head of the HCI group at the Telecooperation Lab of Max Mühlhäuser at TU Darmstadt. I received a doctoral degree from TU Darmstadt where I explored 3D-printed interfaces. I have a background in computer science, psychology, and visual computing. In addition, I have been an affiliated researcher at the SIRIUS Lab , lead by Mohamed Khamis, at the University of Glasgow from 2021 to 2022, where we have investigated tangible approaches to more useable security. Starting from July 2022, I am also an affiliated and visiting researcher at the HCC section, lead by Kasper Hornbæk, at the University of Copenhagen. Together with Daniel Ashbrook, we explore approaches to 3D print haptics, combining my previous research on Fabrication and Haptics. My current research interests are at the intersection of Human-Machine Interfaces and Digital Fabrication, but also include Extended Reality and Haptics. In particular, I enjoy to design, build, and evaluate interfaces that strive to be tailored to individual users or use cases rather than to a common denominator. Feel free to check out my recent publications or contact me. ",
